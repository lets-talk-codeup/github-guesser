    "## Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project was to build a model that can predict the primary programming language for a GitHub repository, given the text of the README file. To achieve this, we first had to decide which and how many repos we wanted to acquire. Microsoft has a large number of repos on its GitHub site with a wide variety of coding languages, so we determined that we could pull the README and coding language from their repos. This required the use of a variety of web scraping and Natural Language Processing tools as well as use of GitHub's API. In the end we acquired 1500 READMEs along with their associated primary coding language from Microsoft's GitHub page. The results are contained in this notebook as well as in a presentation slide deck.\n"

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "After acquiring and exploring the READMEs collected, we determined that the most common coding language in Microsoft's repos was TypeScript. Therefore, we decided to use classification modeling to attempt to predict whether the repos used TypeScript or not based on features from the READMEs. We were able to predict with an 84% accuracy whether a repo used TypeScript or not based on types of words and word length of a README."

    "### How to Recreate:\n",
    "There are two methods that you can use to recreate this project.\n",
    "1. **Quick Method:** Utilize our final .json file with the cleaned README files. This is the simplest method and will produce the same results that we were able to achieve.\n",
    "2. **Long Method:** Start from scratch using the same functions that we used. This will pull in the most recent repos from Microsoft's GitHub page and therefore will produce slightly different results from what we achieved. This method will also take longer e.g. it took us nearly 30 minutes to download the data from the 1500 repos. "
